A simple echo and chat client. 

To run on

* Node.js: type `npm install react-client` and `node lib/app`.
* Cross origin browser: use a code snippet from [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/pocet/8/watch?js,console).
* Same origin browser: copy `lib` directory to a directory for public assets and open `lib/app.html` in browser.

Then, see the console. Once the socket has been opened, you will be able to use it by `socket` in your console interactively.
